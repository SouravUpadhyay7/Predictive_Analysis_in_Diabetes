# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements machine learning classification techniques, with a focus on logistic regression, to predict diabetes occurrence based on various health indicators. Developed under the guidance of Priya Bhatia Ma'am at GeeksforGeeks Complete ML and DS Program.

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels, affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. This project leverages predictive analytics to forecast diabetes occurrence, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in early intervention.

## Approach
The project follows a systematic machine learning pipeline:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Feature analysis and selection
   - Handling missing values
   - Outlier detection and treatment

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling
   - Handling class imbalance
   - Train-test split

3. **Model Implementation**
   - Logistic regression model development
   - Parameter tuning
   - Cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - ROC curve and AUC evaluation

## Dataset
The model utilizes health data including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other relevant health indicators to predict diabetes occurrence. Each record is classified as either diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline
- Class imbalance handling techniques
- Optimized logistic regression implementation
- Detailed performance evaluation


## Development Environment
This project was developed using Google Colab notebook, which provides:
- Free access to GPU resources
- Pre-installed data science libraries
- Easy sharing and collaboration features

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset or connect to the data source
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
4. Modify parameters as needed for experimentation

## Future Scope
- Implementation of additional classification algorithms for comparative analysis
- Feature engineering to improve model performance
- Development of a web interface for real-time predictions
- Incorporation of additional health indicators for better prediction accuracy
